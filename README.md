# Hangman_Typescript
Hangman is the type of game where anyone, young or old, can play. It was my personal favorite way to learn new vocabularies when I first started picking up English. Now using my new skills, I'm able to recreate this lovely game I played when I was younger :)

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript + ReactJS

## Features
- Support virtual keyboard to guess letters
- Color-coded guessed letters (faded: wrong || blue: correct) to help player with their next guess
